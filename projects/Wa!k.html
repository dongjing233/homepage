    <header>Description of Our World</header>
    <p>
      After 30-40 years, the distribution of resources will become more unequal
      because there is a lean of resources in one-child families. The only child
      in a family has more chances to get access to education resources, and it
      makes it even harder for people to get rid of poverty through education.
      At the same time, the only child in the family needs to be responsible for
      taking care of all the elderly people. The structure of the family creates
      more burden for the child and may even cause mental health problems. The
      only child has problems in dealing with complicated social relationships
      to some extent. The population of males will surpass the population of
      females, which leads to further marriage problems. The one-child policy
      will also lead to an aging population. The percentage of elders might take
      a big part in the population in China after the one-child policy. In
      China, there is a tradition to take care and look after their parents when
      they are old. In this generation, most families of two parents only have
      one child. Therefore, there might be more burden on the only child. It
      might be hard for their child to take care of their parents alone, without
      siblings. Society might want to build more nursing homes, elder
      apartments, services, and products for elders.

      UI
    </header>
    <p>
      We chose this navy color as our theme color because it conveys peaceful
      and reliable visual information. The color and the big font size are
      readable and friendly for the elderly. Users can chat with AI when they
      feel lonely or boring. As the users give instructions to the AI, the AI
      will execute it and give feedback to the users.

      UI for Parents
    </header>
    <p>
      We divide the interface into 3 fundamental sections, navigation, chatting,
      and music player. Users are able to switch between these 3 sections by
      simply tapping on the navigation bar or giving verbal instructions. The
      navigation function is easy to operate, users can tell the AI where they
      want to go, the AI will calculate the safest and fastest route and guide
      them to their destinations. The users can create their own playlist or
      play some random music recommend by the AI in the music player.

      UI for Children
    </header>
    <p>
      The app for children allows them to report missing person to local police
      office and find the location of their parents on map. Children can call
      their parents using the shortcut when they miss them or when there is an
      emergency.
