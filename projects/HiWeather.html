    <header>Overview</header>
    <p>
      I redesigned a weather app with my partner Yeji Kim. Our target users are
      children and our aim was to create a more delightful and understandable
      experience for children who are using this app. We added outfit
      suggestions and activity recommendations to our app to create more
      interactions with the children and build a concept of weather and
      temperature. We also applied a series of animation to make the experience
      more enjoyable and immersive.

      Painpoints
    </header>
    <p>
      Children usually do not have a concept of weather and temperature,
      especially for younger kids who have not learned any mathematics. They
      rely on their parents to make their outfit decisions and they might not
      know what are the most suitable activities based on the current weather
      condition. Our app reaches out to these pain points and solves these
      common problems among kids.

      Value Proposition
    </header>
    <p>
      <b>Affordance:</b> Since our app was designed for children, we simplified
      our interfaces and made them really easy to read and interact with. We
      created a navigation bar on the bottom and users can shift between
      different pages by clicking on the buttons. We didn't make any subpages
      because the operation might be too complicated for kids. <br /><b
        >Delightfulness:</b
      >
      We created several interactive animations in this app to attract the kids'
      attention and arouse their interest in using this app. We also added sound
      effects to the fitting room while they click on different items of
      clothing and put them on. We thought the experience would be more fun and
      enjoyable. <br /><b>Feedback:</b> We thought the fitting room should give
      in-time feedbacks to our users to make the experience more engaging. We
      added this fitting room function in the form of a dress-up game. <br /><b
        >Aesthetics:</b
      >
      We wanted to make the app more friendly for children. So we basically used
      illustrated information as our content. The illustrations we picked were
      cute and lively. Our bouncing animation added more savor to the app. We
      created a vivid color scheme and the background color would change in
      response to the weather. <br /><b>Learnability:</b> The interactions and
      hierarchies of the app are very direct and simple. The users can find
      easily learn about how this app was structured and use it for different
      purposes. <br /><b>Accessibility:</b> We noticed that many kids could not
      read numbers, so numbers and other abstract indications might not be
      applied widely in our app. On our profile page, we used the image of
      different numbers on dices to make them select their age. We put a series
      of icons, illustrations, and colors to convey information about the
      weather and temperature.
